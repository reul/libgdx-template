# libgdx-template

Generated by [gdx-liftoff](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-liftoff) and edited to
use kotlin script and up-to-date library versions.

iOS support is **not** included, so if you want that, you will either need to 
set it up from scratch or use gdx-liftoff or other generators. You can check
[awesome-libgdx](https://project-awesome.org/rafaskb/awesome-libgdx#setup-and-deployment) 
repository for ideas, if you don't know exactly what you want to use.

## Introduction

I've been wanting to try LibGDX, but I got detained a couple of times on the
initial setup, as I wanted to modernize the technology stack and use kotlin
script instead of groovy for the build scripts.

This repository is an effort to build a template I can use in the future to
bootstrap a LibGDX project in minutes instead of hours. Feel free to copy or 
fork, and have fun!


## Usage

You can either use IntelliJ IDEs or the gradle wrapper (gradlew) script present
in the repository root. It's supposed to build in any of the 3 big OSs, even 
though I don't own a Mac computer and my Windows partition is abandoned for 
years (meaning I only tested this code in GNU/Linux).

To simply run the project, you can execute the run tasks present in the desktop
and/or in the android modules:

    $ ./gradlew :desktop:run
    $ ./gradlew :android:run

You can also check other present tasks by running:

    $ ./gradlew tasks
